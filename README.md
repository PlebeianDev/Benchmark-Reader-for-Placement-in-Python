# Bookshelf-Format-Parser

# About The Project
Benchmark Reader is project that was created as a "by-product" of 2-year experimentation on creating mini hardware placement utilities tools, and other placement related projects.
It serves as a file-parser of all Bookshelf-format Benchmarks and creates an object oriented form of benchmark, as shown below, all according to bookshelf format and standards.
 -  Benchmark (Map):
  - Rows
  - Nets
  - Cells

### Built with 
- Python 3.7.3, compatible with any python 3x.

# Getting Started 
- Read/View [example.py](https://github.com/PlebeianDev/Benchmark-Reader-for-Placement-in-Python/blob/master/src/example.py) for simple usage example.
- Be sure to check example.py via a python debugger, so you can have a full view of the design and classes/objects.
- If used as a whole, be sure to place all the project files in the same folder.
- If functions are used separately, will need minor changes depending on how you want to use them.
